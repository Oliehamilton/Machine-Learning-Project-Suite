Exploring Machine Learning Applications Across Multiple Domains: Clustering and Classification, Regression, Forecasting, and Recommendations

In this project, I explored various machine-learning techniques across multiple datasets to address distinct analytical challenges. 
The project encompassed four primary tasks: clustering and classification of agricultural data to identify patterns and groupings, 
regression analysis to predict academic performance based on student data, time series forecasting to anticipate future air passenger trends, 
and the development of a recommendation system for an online retail environment. 
Each model was tailored to leverage the unique characteristics of its respective dataset, providing insightful predictions and actionable insights.

Key Responsibilities:
1.	Clustering and Classification (Dry Bean Dataset):
  - Performed clustering analysis on the Dry Bean dataset, selecting the most appropriate algorithm based on the data characteristics.
  - Added the clustering outcomes to the dataset and developed two classification models to assess their effectiveness in predicting the cluster categories.
  - Summarised the findings, highlighting the performance of each model and insights gained from the clustering process.
2.	Regression Analysis (Student Performance Dataset):
  - Developed two regression models to analyse the Student Performance dataset, focusing on predicting specific academic outcomes.
  - Evaluated and compared the models to determine which provided better predictive accuracy and insights into student performance.
  - Provided a comprehensive summary of the findings, discussing the implications for educational strategies and the models' performance.
3.	Time Series Forecasting (Air Passengers Dataset):
  - Applied two time series models to the Air Passengers dataset to forecast future passenger volumes.
  - Justified the choice of models in relation to the data, making one-step-ahead forecasts for the last 10 observations.
  - Included visualisations to identify trends, patterns, and anomalies and summarised the challenges and effectiveness of the forecasting models.
4.	Recommendation System (Online Retail Dataset):
  - Developed a recommendation system using the Online Retail dataset to provide personalized product recommendations.
  - Identified three possible recommendations for three random customers, demonstrating the system's ability to generate relevant suggestions based on purchasing patterns.
  - Summarized the approach and effectiveness of the recommendation system in enhancing customer experience.
